Metal price news 2023

Summer has hit the stainless steel market, and we don't expect any major news in the coming months. Alloy surcharges are slowly decreasing, and most of the production in Southern Europe will be closed in August.
Summer has hit the stainless steel market, and we don't expect any major news in the coming months. Alloy surcharges are slowly decreasing, and most of the production in Southern Europe will be closed in August.
Looking at the rest of the year, there are two primary uncertainties.
One is when the European, American, and Chinese economies will pick up speed again. The other is how much production capacity the European plants will cut to meet the lower demand.
DISCLAIMER
Sheets
We expect stability in the coming months.
Alloy surcharges have been decreasing for six consecutive months, and we will see that on 4301 and 4404.
Bars
Lead times are still moving in a reasonable direction. Currently, the longest lead times are 4-5 months.
In general, we expect stability on bars, and prices will likely remain at a low level. Energy surcharges are still manageable: €30-40/ton from multiple plants.
Commodities
Nickel
Nickel is slightly unstable at the moment, fluctuating between $20,000 and $23,000 per ton.
There is still pressure on the LME. It is unclear whether the exchange will expand with more nickel grades to compensate for the current low supply.
Molybdenum
Molybdenum is still stable at $50,000 per kg, and there are no signs of either upwards or downwards movement in the near future.
